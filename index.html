        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Woody, a 16-year-old developer from the south of England. Beyond coding, I'm also a karate black
            belt, which has instilled in me discipline and focus that I apply to my work. I love creating new software
            to solve existing problems. Back in 2015, on a flight to London from Berlin, my Dad introduced me to <a
                href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, a simple block coding language, to keep me
            entertained. Little did I know, this would be the start of my path into programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent a long time watching and helping my father as he experimented with <a href="https://php.net"
                target="_blank">PHP</a>, and before long I was writing my own code. I've taught myself most of what I
            know since, driven by curiosity and a passion for puzzles, much like the dedication required to achieve a
            black belt.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the best opportunities I had was developing for a small but active Minecraft server. The owner was
            very kind to give me access to develop for the server and in doing so opened my eyes to version control with
            <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> and code reviews. This taught me not only technical
            skills which have helped in other areas but also instilled good habits for writing readable and efficient
            code.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, I've had a ton of fun coding for various personal projects. From tinkering with Scratch, to
            improving my skills on a Minecraft server, to now developing my own train app. I am excited to see where
            this journey will take me next, and I believe the discipline I've gained through karate will continue to
            serve me well in my development pursuits.
